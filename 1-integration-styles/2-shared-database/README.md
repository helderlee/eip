# Shared Database EIP



Pros:

- Rapid updates allow better consistencies
- Defined data format avoids semantic dissonance



Cons:

- Suitable design
- Severe political difficulties
- Integrations limitation
- Performance bottlenecks and deadlocks
- Business processes rules is not taken into account across different applications
- Database triggers are not enough because the same data structure can participate in different business processes and different timelines
- Systems are often very reluctant to change the database
- Application development work is much less responsive to the changing needs of the business
- Share data, not functionality
