- The different applications are quite nicely decoupled from each other



Cons:

- Undefined data format may cause semantic dissonance
- Expensive resource costs with processing
- Scheduled Timetable
- Lack of timeliness
- Stale information
- Data inconsistencies
- Business processes rules is not taken into account across different applications
- Allows an application to react to changes as it processes the file, but the process is delayed
- Share data, not functionality
